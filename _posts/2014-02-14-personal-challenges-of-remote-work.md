Remote work is at the core of our [little company](https://travis-ci.com). I've
written about how we improve our tool set to [foster and improve communication
in our
team](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-02-03-how-we-manage-work-in-a-remote-team/)
and about our [company values as a distributed
team](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-02-13-how-we-roll-as-a-team/).

Working in a distributed team poses personal challenges too, and by jolly, I've
been busy working through my fair share of them.

I've been working from home for all of last year, and I've done a few mistakes
along the way that caused me frustration and decreased my productivity.

### Embrace the solitude

The best part about working from home is that there are no distractions. We have
a lot more room, compared to an office, to get work done.

The downside is that as attention-seeking humans, we tend to look for
distractions if we don't have any.

If you follow me on Twitter (which [you should](https://twitter.com/roidrage),
you'll know that tweets come in bursts. These bursts tend to represent times of
boredom, times where I can't find any mental room to concentrate on working.

When you're alone at home, you look for contact with other people. The internet
is a great place for that. There are things happening on certain news websites,
on Twitter, Facebook, in IRC, in our team chat.

Of course, the worst offender of them all is email. Are you opening your email
client first thing in the morning? Are you excited about seeing 50 unread emails
waiting to be processed and replied to?

Me neither.

It's a weird reflex that we turn to email first, well knowing that what's
expecting us commonly isn't urgent and drains creative fluids before any
creative work gets done.

This has been the most frustrating to me in the last couple of months.

### Cut out unnecessary distractions

I've started forcing myself to not open email before noon. I tend to be the most
creative in the morning hours, and with the team slowly waking up throughout the
day, the amount of other distractions increases too.

I've also found myself frustrated and mentally drained going through emails
before doing anything else.

It took me a year to be fully aware of this.

So I started postponing email. It takes getting used to changing this habit,
that's why forcing yourself to do it is all the more important. I also make my
team aware of this, but expectations commonly aren't that replies should be sent
within hours. All communication is asynchronous, and so is email. If there's
something urgent, there's always the phone.

I've started doing the same with Twitter too. I love reading what's going on
with the people I follow, but it sucks away concentration too.

For being in a creative workline, we have a curious tendency of actively looking
for distractions where we could put the energy to much better use.
  
**Avoid email and Twitter, anything distracting before work.**
  
As [Jason Rudolph put
it](http://wynnnetherland.com/journal/i-love-the-smell-of-facepalm-in-the-morning), **create before consuming**. This way is much more
fulfilling than trying to muster up energy to get something done after you've
consumed Twitter, email and other distractions.

I've stopped reading emails on weekends too. I found my weekends much more
relaxing since then.

### Make small commitments

I went for months without having any specific goals. It was very frustrating
as I didn't really feel I got anything done during a day. I probably did, but
I forgot what it was at the end of it.

I usually keep a daily list of tasks around. Just a piece of paper and a
pencil is sufficient.

Takes a few minutes in the morning to think about what I want to get done, but
taking that time to think about it already gives you the feeling of having
goals.

Being able to cross them off a list with a physical activity, like violently
striking through the tasks, can be rewarding.

At the end of the day, you'll have a list of tasks you got done.

If you didn't get one of them done, maybe it needs to be broken down into
smaller steps?

**Big tasks kill productivity**, as they appear to never be fully done.

Break them down.

I've started tracking things I've committed doing every single day with a
little iPhone app called Commit. It's quite handy to track daily walks,
writing and doing pushups every day. You'll be surprised how quickly you can
ramp up the number of pushups you can do when you do them daily.

### Escape the solitude

I love working in a remote team.

But just as much, I love being with and talking to people, even if it's just
listening to their problems, listening to what news they have.

I've gone a month or so without meeting other people, which was rather
depressing. I've gone for months just sitting down at the kitchen table, never
getting up until 10 hours later. These habits are so easy to slip into, and
they need conscious efforts to get out of.

Since then, I've started forcing myself to go for a walk or a bike ride every
day.

Not only does this help with the overall fitness and well-being, it gives the
mind time to breeze. When you don't focus on anything else, your mind can
regenerate. It appears this is even scientifically proven.

I've went for months without ever leaving the house, other than to drop off my
daughter at the kindergarten. Believe me, those months I've felt miserable.

**Go for a walk, every day.**

Working from home is hard. I've been doing it for more than a year now, but
I'm still struggling to get it right.

Being more productive standing up, I got a new standing desk rig set up in my
little home office. You'd be surprised how much dancing while working can lift
your spirits.

I've been reading a lot of articles and posts on working from home, and I
agree on their general premise. **You need to push yourself harder to focus on
getting work done.**

The line between work and life gets thinner working from home, and working in
a company with lots of customers from overseas, calling it a day is even
harder.

But I've learned to trust my team, which is distributed across the globe.

I'm starting to learn to disconnect.
