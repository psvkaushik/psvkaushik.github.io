I’m looking for a new role as CTO or VP/Head of Engineering (or COO), or similar, remote or in Berlin (relocating is not an option for me).

I consider myself an empathic leader with a servant and a growth mindset. I focus on people first, making sure they can do their best work.

I have a founder and CEO background of building up a company from scratch and bring understanding of all parts of the business, their value, and the importance of communicating and collaborating across functions.

My areas of interest:

* Engineering and company culture of collaboration, shipping, and quality
* Business and engineering strategy
* Collaboration across the entire business
* Mentoring and coaching of (engineering) managers and leads
* Inclusion and diversity
* People and processes
* High performance organisations and teams
* Strong feedback loops across teams
* Remote teams and culture
* Culture shifts and transformations

My most recent work background:

* Founder (6 years) and CEO (4 years) at [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com): grew team from 10 to 50, managing a team of teams, engineering teams, leadership team and departments
* (Infrastructure) engineer turned leader, manager and team builder
* Product- and business-focus with a technology angle
* Focus: Developer tooling, B2B, building a business around open source, SaaS, enterprise software and sales
* [Executive & leadership coach](/leadership-coaching/)

I’m looking to join a growth stage B2B company (5-10+ MM ARR, or post Series A, and beyond; 25+ people in engineering) that values diversity and inclusion, where technology is a key part of the business, and where I can help grow and scale the engineering teams to the next level.
